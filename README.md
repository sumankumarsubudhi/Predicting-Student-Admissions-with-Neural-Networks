# Predicting-Student-Admissions-with-Neural-Networks

In this notebook, we predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:

- GRE Scores (Test)
- GPA Scores (Grades)
- Class rank (1-4)

*In this, I have implemented some of the steps in the training of the neural network, namely:

- One-hot encoding the data
- Scaling the data
- Writing the backpropagation step



The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/
